# Airline Loyalty Assistant Enhancement Task

Enhance the existing Airline Loyalty Assistant web application by implementing conversation memory to provide a more personalized and contextual user experience.

## Enhancement Overview

The current application provides answers about airline loyalty programs using an LLM through LangChain4j, but treats each interaction as isolated. This enhancement will:

1. Add the ability to maintain conversation context across multiple interactions
2. Enable the assistant to reference prior messages in the conversation
3. Allow for more natural, flowing conversations with the assistant

## Technical Requirements

- Continue following **ALL** specifications in the `.windsurfrules` file
- Use LangChain4j's conversation memory capabilities
- Implement a lightweight approach aligned with the project's minimalist philosophy
- Maintain the existing simplified architecture and UI approach

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Session Management**:
   - Implement a simple session identification mechanism
   - Associate user conversations with their session
   - Ensure conversation context persists throughout the session

2. **Memory Implementation**:
   - Create a conversation memory store compatible with LangChain4j
   - Implement mechanisms to store and retrieve past messages
   - Limit conversation history to a reasonable size to avoid context overload

3. **Enhanced Question Answering**:
   - Update the existing question answering logic to incorporate conversation history
   - Allow the LLM to reference previous exchanges when formulating responses
   - Support follow-up questions that rely on previously established context

4. **Response Improvement**:
   - Enable more natural conversation flows and contextual responses
   - Support references to past interactions without requiring the user to repeat information

## User Experience

- The UI should remain simple and unchanged from the user's perspective
- Users should be able to ask follow-up questions without restating context
- The assistant should remember user preferences and information shared during the conversation

## Development Approach

- Maintain the same simplified architecture as the original implementation
- Keep the core principles of minimalism and demo-readiness
- Prioritize working functionality over architectural complexity
- Ensure the application continues to start with a single command (`./gradlew quarkusDev`)
- Use in-memory storage for session data in this demo implementation

## Testing Considerations

- Test with multi-turn conversations to verify context retention
- Verify that the assistant correctly references previous parts of the conversation
- Ensure the experience feels natural and continuous to users

This enhancement should significantly improve the conversational quality of the assistant while maintaining the lightweight, demonstration-focused nature of the application.
