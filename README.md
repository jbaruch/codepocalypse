# Codepocalypse - AI Prompt Engineering Examples

This repository contains a collection of prompts, rules, and guidelines for implementing AI-powered applications using different frameworks and approaches.

## Project Overview

Codepocalypse is a collection of resources for AI prompt engineering and implementation guidelines, focusing on building AI-powered applications using frameworks like Spring AI and LangChain4j. The repository provides structured prompts and detailed implementation rules for creating demo applications, particularly an "Airline Loyalty Assistant".

## Repository Structure

- **langchain4j-prompts/**: Contains prompt examples for implementing applications using LangChain4j
  - `01-basic.md`: Basic implementation task for an Airline Loyalty Assistant
  - `02-memory.md`: Memory-related implementation examples
  - `03-rag.md`: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation examples
  - `04-mcp.md`: Multi-modal Content Processing examples

- **spring-pdd/**: Contains resources for Prompt-Driven Development with Spring
  - `initial-prompts.md`: "Golden Prompts" to start with for Prompt-Driven Development

- **langchain4j-rules.md**: Detailed implementation rules for building applications with LangChain4j and Quarkus

- **springai-rules.md**: Detailed implementation rules for building applications with Spring AI and Spring Boot

## Usage

This repository serves as a reference for developers looking to implement AI-powered applications using different frameworks. The prompts and rules can be used as starting points for your own projects.

### Getting Started

1. Review the appropriate rules file based on your preferred framework:
   - For Spring AI: `springai-rules.md`
   - For LangChain4j: `langchain4j-rules.md`

2. Explore the prompt examples in the respective directories to understand implementation approaches

3. Follow the Prompt-Driven Development approach outlined in `spring-pdd/initial-prompts.md`

## Key Concepts

- **Prompt-Driven Development (PDD)**: A development approach that uses AI prompts to guide the implementation process
- **Implementation Rules**: Detailed guidelines for building applications with specific frameworks and versions
- **Prompt Examples**: Sample prompts for implementing different features and functionalities
